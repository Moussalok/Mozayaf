    content: `In the heart of the ancient mountains lay a forest that never spoke. Birds flew over it but never nested in its branches. The wind whistled through the peaks but died down the moment it touched the emerald leaves. One day, a young boy named Leo decided to enter. He didn't bring a map, only a compass and a heart full of curiosity. As he walked deeper, the silence began to hum—a low, rhythmic vibration that felt like a heartbeat. He realized the forest wasn't silent because it was dead, but because it was holding its breath, waiting for someone to listen to its secrets.`

    content: `When the oceans rose, humanity didn't build ships; they built cities in the deep. Luminescent domes glowed like jellyfish in the dark abyss. Sarah, an engineer, looked out her window at the passing schools of neon-lit fish. Life below was different—the weight of the water made everything feel slow and deliberate. But today, a sensor triggered on the outer shell of the main hub. Something was knocking. Not a machine, but a rhythmic tap-tap-tap. A language they hadn't heard in centuries.`

    content: `Long ago, there was a compass that didn't point North. It pointed to your greatest dream. A girl named Mia found it in her grandfather's attic. When she held it, the needle spun wildly before landing on a direction toward the desert. She packed her bags and started her journey. Along the way, she met many people who offered her gold and silver, but the needle never moved. Finally, she reached a small, quiet oasis. There, she found an old library. Mia realized her dream wasn't gold, but knowledge.`
